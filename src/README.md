**Azurra Framework v0.2 beta**

This code is distributed under the GPL v3 license, as the original project states.

All themes are original copies of the B00merang Project's source SCSS, found [here](https://github.com/B00merang-Project/Azurra_framework/)

This is an acceptable way to distribute source code without having to manually copy it over to a new reference theme.
